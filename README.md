# To recruiter, Yours respectfully

## Background Story

I often get LinkedIn messages from recruiters about exciting opportunities which I'm thrilled to explore.

However, a few recruiters send me messages with very vague and generic information.

There's no doubt that these recruiters have valid reasons for doing so; nonetheless, my interest in that opportunity dramatically drops.

I would prefer to receive job opportunity messages with more detailed information, such as responsibilites, tech stacks, location, and company size, etc.

It would be great if they could also share the salary range.

I want to automatically reply to those recruiters kindly that I'm not interested.
